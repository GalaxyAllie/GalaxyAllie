### Hi, I'm Allie! 🧜‍♀️

I'm Allie (she/her or ze/zir) and I work on support things at GitHub. In my free time, I love making cute and glittery things, with lots of LEDs and 🧜‍♀️s and 🦄s! Currently, I'm working on learning Ruby as well as continuing my learning journey with microcontrollers. TI-RTOS is one of my next planned learning projects.

I like mobile network and information security stuff as well, and in my spare time I'm also learning about IoT stuffs.
